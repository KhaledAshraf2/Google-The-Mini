Book XXII
Slaughter in
the Hall
Now stripping back his rags Odysseus master of craft and battle
vaulted onto the great threshold, gripping his bow and quiver
bristling arrows, and poured his flashing shafts before him,
loose at his feet, and thundered out to all the suitors:
“Look—your crucial test is finished, now, at last!
But another target’s left that no one’s hit before—
we’ll see if I can hit it—Apollo give me glory!”
With that he trained a stabbing arrow on Antinous …
just lifting a gorgeous golden loving-cup in his hands,
just tilting the two-handled goblet back to his lips,
about to drain the wine—and slaughter the last thing
on the suitor’s mind: who could dream that one foe
in that crowd of feasters, however great his power,
would bring down death on himself, and black doom?
But Odysseus aimed and shot Antinous square in the throat
and the point went stabbing clean through the soft neck and out—
and off to the side he pitched, the cup dropped from his grasp
as the shaft sank home, and the man’s life-blood came spurting
out his nostrils—
thick red jets—
a sudden thrust of his foot—
he kicked away the table—
food showered across the floor,
the bread and meats soaked in a swirl of bloody filth.
The suitors burst into uproar all throughout the house
when they saw their leader down. They leapt from their seats,
milling about, desperate, scanning the stone walls—
not a shield in sight, no rugged spear to seize.
They wheeled on Odysseus, lashing out in fury:
“Stranger, shooting at men will cost your life!”
“Your game is over—you, you’ve shot your last!”
“You’ll never escape your own headlong death!”
“You killed the best in Ithaca—our fine prince!”
“Vultures will eat your corpse!”
Groping, frantic—
each one persuading himself the guest had killed
the man by chance. Poor fools, blind to the fact
that all their necks were in the noose, their doom sealed.
With a dark look, the wily fighter Odysseus shouted back,
“You dogs! you never imagined I’d return from Troy—
so cocksure that you bled my house to death,
ravished my serving-women—wooed my wife
behind my back while I was still alive!
No fear of the gods who rule the skies up there,
no fear that men’s revenge might arrive someday—
now all your necks are in the noose—your doom is sealed!”
Terror gripped them all, blanched their faces white,
each man glancing wildly—how to escape his instant death?
Only Eurymachus had the breath to venture, “If you,
you’re truly Odysseus of Ithaca, home at last,
you’re right to accuse these men of what they’ve done—
so much reckless outrage here in your palace,
so much on your lands. But here he lies,
quite dead, and he incited it all—Antinous—
look, the man who drove us all to crime!
Not that he needed marriage, craved it so;
he’d bigger game in mind—though Zeus barred his way—
he’d lord it over Ithaca’s handsome country, king himself,
once he’d lain in wait for your son and cut him down!
But now he’s received the death that he deserved.
So spare your own people! Later we’ll recoup
your costs with a tax laid down upon the land,
covering all we ate and drank inside your halls,
and each of us here will pay full measure too—
twenty oxen in value, bronze and gold we’ll give
until we melt your heart. Before we’ve settled,
who on earth could blame you for your rage?”
But the battle-master kept on glaring, seething.
“No, Eurymachus! Not if you paid me all your father’s wealth—
all you possess now, and all that could pour in from the world’s end—
no, not even then would I stay my hands from slaughter
till all you suitors had paid for all your crimes!
Now life or death—your choice—fight me or flee
if you hope to escape your sudden bloody doom!
I doubt one man in the lot will save his skin!”
His menace shook their knees, their hearts too
but Eurymachus spoke again, now to the suitors: “Friends!
This man will never restrain his hands, invincible hands—
now that he’s seized that polished bow and quiver, look,
he’ll shoot from the sill until he’s killed us all!
So fight—call up the joy of battle! Swords out!
Tables lifted—block his arrows winging death!
Charge him, charge in a pack—
try to rout the man from the sill, the doors,
race through town and sound an alarm at once—
our friend would soon see he’s shot his bolt!”
Brave talk—
he drew his two-edged sword, bronze, honed for the kill
and hurled himself at the king with a raw savage cry
in the same breath that Odysseus loosed an arrow
ripping his breast beside the nipple so hard
it lodged in the man’s liver—
Out of his grasp the sword dropped to the ground—
over his table, head over heels he tumbled, doubled up,
flinging his food and his two-handled cup across the floor—
he smashed the ground with his forehead, writhing in pain,
both feet flailing out, and his high seat tottered—
the mist of death came swirling down his eyes.
Amphinomus rushed the king in all his glory,
charging him face-to-face, a slashing sword drawn—
if only he could force him clear of the doorway, now,
but Telemachus—too quick—stabbed the man from behind,
plunging his bronze spear between the suitor’s shoulders
and straight on through his chest the point came jutting out—
down he went with a thud, his forehead slammed the ground.
Telemachus swerved aside, leaving his long spearshaft
lodged in Amphinomus—fearing some suitor just might
lunge in from behind as he tugged the shaft,
impale him with a sword or hack him down,
crouching over the corpse.
He went on the run, reached his father at once
and halting right beside him, let fly, “Father—
now I’ll get you a shield and a pair of spears,
a helmet of solid bronze to fit your temples!
I’ll arm myself on the way back and hand out
arms to the swineherd, arm the cowherd too—
we’d better fight equipped!”
“Run, fetch them,”
the wily captain urged, “while I’ve got arrows left
to defend me—or they’ll force me from the doors
while I fight on alone!”
Telemachus moved to his father’s orders smartly.
Off he ran to the room where the famous arms lay stored,
took up four shields, eight spears, four bronze helmets
ridged with horsehair crests and, loaded with these,
ran back to reach his father’s side in no time.
The prince was first to case himself in bronze
and his servants followed suit—both harnessed up
and all three flanked Odysseus, mastermind of war,
and he, as long as he’d arrows left to defend himself,
kept picking suitors off in the palace, one by one
and down they went, corpse on corpse in droves.
Then, when the royal archer’s shafts ran out,
he leaned his bow on a post of the massive doors—
where walls of the hallway catch the light—and armed:
across his shoulder he slung a buckler four plies thick,
over his powerful head he set a well-forged helmet,
the horsehair crest atop it tossing, bristling terror,
and grasped two rugged lances tipped with fiery bronze.
Now a side-door was fitted into the main wall—
right at the edge of the great hall’s stone sill—
and led to a passage always shut by good tight boards.
But Odysseus gave the swineherd strict commands
to stand hard by the side-door, guard it well—
the only way the suitors might break out.
Agelaus called to his comrades with a plan:
“Friends, can’t someone climb through the hatch?—
tell men outside to sound the alarm, be quick—
our guest would soon see he’d shot his last!”
The goatherd Melanthius answered, “Not a chance,
my lord—the door to the courtyard’s much too near,
dangerous too, the mouth of the passage cramped.
One strong man could block us, one and all!
No, I’ll fetch you some armor to harness on,
out of the storeroom—there, nowhere else, I’m sure,
the king and his gallant son have stowed their arms!”
With that the goatherd clambered up through smoke-ducts
high on the wall arid scurried into Odysseus’ storeroom,
bundled a dozen shields, as many spears and helmets
ridged with horsehair crests and, loaded with these,
rushed back down to the suitors, quickly issued arms.
Odysseus’ knees shook, his heart too, when he saw them
buckling on their armor, brandishing long spears—
here was a battle looming, well he knew.
He turned at once to Telemachus, warnings flying:
“A bad break in the fight, my boy! One of the women’s
tipped the odds against us—or could it be the goatherd?”
“My fault, father,” the cool clear prince replied,
“the blame’s all mine. That snug door to the vault,
I left it ajar—they’ve kept a better watch than I.
Go, Eumaeus, shut the door to the storeroom,
check and see if it’s one of the women’s tricks
or Dolius’ son Melanthius. He’s our man, I’d say.”
And even as they conspired, back the goatherd
climbed to the room to fetch more burnished arms,
but Eumaeus spotted him, quickly told his king
who stood close by: “Odysseus, wily captain,
there he goes again, the infernal nuisance—
just as we suspected—back to the storeroom.
Give me a clear command!
Do I kill the man—if I can take him down—
or drag him back to you, here, to pay in full
for the dirty work he’s plotted in your house?”
Odysseus, master of tactics, answered briskly,
“I and the prince will keep these brazen suitors
crammed in the hall, for all their battle-fury.
You two wrench Melanthius’ arms and legs behind him,
fling him down in the storeroom—lash his back to a plank
and strap a twisted cable fast to the scoundrel’s body,
hoist him up a column until he hits the rafters—
let him dangle in agony, still alive,
for a good long time!”
They hung on his orders, keen to do his will.
Off they ran to the storeroom, unseen by him inside—
Melanthius, rummaging after arms, deep in a dark recess
as the two men took their stand, either side the doorposts,
poised till the goatherd tried to cross the doorsill …
one hand clutching a crested helmet, the other
an ample old buckler blotched with mildew,
the shield Laertes bore as a young soldier once—
but there it lay for ages, seams on the handstraps split—
Quick, they rushed him, seized him, haled him back by the hair,
flung him down on the floor, writhing with terror, bound him
hand and foot with a chafing cord, wrenched his limbs
back, back till the joints locked tight—
just as Laertes’ cunning son commanded—
they strapped a twisted cable round his body,
hoisted him up a column until he hit the rafters,
then you mocked him, Eumaeus, my good swineherd:
“Now stand guard through the whole night, Melanthius—
stretched out on a soft bed fit for you, your highness!
You’re bound to see the Morning rising up from the Ocean,
mounting her golden throne—at just the hour you always
drive in goats to feast the suitors in the hall!”
So they left him, trussed in his agonizing sling;
they clapped on armor again, shut the gleaming doors
and ran to rejoin Odysseus, mastermind of war.
And now as the ranks squared off, breathing fury—
four at the sill confronting a larger, stronger force
arrayed inside the hall—now Zeus’s daughter Athena,
taking the build and voice of Mentor, swept in
and Odysseus, thrilled to see her, cried out,
“Rescue us, Mentor, now it’s life or death!
Remember your old comrade—all the service
I offered you! We were boys together!”
So he cried
yet knew in his bones it was Athena, Driver of Armies.
But across the hall the suitors brayed against her,
Agelaus first, his outburst full of threats:
“Mentor, never let Odysseus trick you into
siding with him to fight against the suitors.
Here’s our plan of action, and we will see it through!
Once we’ve killed them both, the father and the son,
we’ll kill you too, for all you’re bent on doing
here in the halls—you’ll pay with your own head!
And once our swords have stopped your violence cold—
all your property, all in your house, your fields,
we’ll lump it all with Odysseus’ rich estate
and never let your sons live on in your halls
or free your wife and daughters to walk through town!”
Naked threats—and Athena hit new heights of rage,
she lashed out at Odysseus now with blazing accusations:
“Where’s it gone, Odysseus—your power, your fighting heart?
The great soldier who fought for famous white-armed Helen,
battling Trojans nine long years—nonstop, no mercy,
mowing their armies down in grueling battle—
you who seized the broad streets of Troy
with your fine strategic stroke! How can you—
now you’ve returned to your own house, your own wealth—
bewail the loss of your combat strength in a war with suitors?
Come, old friend, stand by me! You’ll see action now,
see how Mentor the son of Alcimus, that brave fighter,
kills your enemies, pays you back for service!”
Rousing words—
but she gave no all-out turning of the tide, not yet,
she kept on testing Odysseus and his gallant son,
putting their force and fighting heart to proof.
For all the world like a swallow in their sight
she flew on high to perch
on the great hall’s central roofbeam black with smoke.
But the suitors closed ranks, commanded now by Damastor’s
sonAgelaus, flanked by Eurynomus, Demoptolemus and Amphimedon,
Pisander, Polyctor’s son, and Polybus ready, waiting—
head and shoulders the best and bravest of the lot
still left to fight for their lives,
now that the pelting shafts had killed the rest.
Agelaus spurred his comrades on with battle-plans:
“Friends, at last the man’s invincible hands are useless!
Mentor has mouthed some empty boasts and flitted off—
just four are left to fight at the front doors. So now,
no wasting your long spears—all at a single hurl,
just six of us launch out in the first wave!
If Zeus is willing, we may hit Odysseus,
carry off the glory! The rest are nothing
once the captain’s down!”
At his command,
concentrating their shots, all six hurled as one
but Athena sent the whole salvo wide of the mark—
one of them hit the jamb of the great hall’s doors,
another the massive door itself, and the heavy bronze point
of a third ashen javelin crashed against the wall.
Seeing his men untouched by the suitors’ flurry,
steady Odysseus leapt to take command:
“Friends! now it’s for us to hurl at them, I say,
into this ruck of suitors! Topping all their crimes
they’re mad to strip the armor off our bodies!”
Taking aim at the ranks, all four let fly as one
and the lances struck home—Odysseus killed Demoptolemus,
Telemachus killed Euryades—the swineherd, Elatus—
and the cowherd cut Pisander down in blood.
They bit the dust of the broad floor, all as one.
Back to the great hall’s far recess the others shrank
as the four rushed in and plucked up spears from corpses.
And again the suitors hurled their whetted shafts
but Athena sent the better part of the salvo wide—
one of them hit the jamb of the great hall’s doors,
another the massive door itself, and the heavy bronze point
of a third ashen javelin crashed against the wall.
True, Amphimedon nicked Telemachus on the wrist—
the glancing blade just barely broke his skin.
Ctesippus sent a long spear sailing over
Eumaeus’ buckler, grazing his shoulder blade
but the weapon skittered off and hit the ground.
And again those led by the brilliant battle-master
hurled their razor spears at the suitors’ ranks—
and now Odysseus raider of cities hit Eurydamas,
Telemachus hit Amphimedon—Eumaeus, Polybus—
and the cowherd stabbed Ctesippus
right in the man’s chest and triumphed over his body:
“Love your mockery, do you? Son of that blowhard Polytherses!
No more shooting off your mouth, you idiot, such big talk—
leave the last word to the gods—they’re much stronger!
Take this spear, this guest-gift, for the cow’s hoof
you once gave King Odysseus begging in his house!”
So the master of longhorn cattle had his say—
as Odysseus, fighting at close quarters, ran Agelaus
through with a long lance—Telemachus speared Leocritus
so deep in the groin the bronze came punching out his back
and the man crashed headfirst, slamming the ground full-face.
And now Athena, looming out of the rafters high above them,
brandished her man-destroying shield of thunder, terrifying
the suitors out of their minds, and down the hall they panicked—
wild, like herds stampeding, driven mad as the darting gadfly
strikes in the late spring when the long days come round.
The attackers struck like eagles, crook-clawed, hook-beaked,
swooping down from a mountain ridge to harry smaller birds
that skim across the flatland, cringing under the clouds
but the eagles plunge in fury, rip their lives out—hopeless,
never a chance of flight or rescue—and people love the sport—
so the attackers routed suitors headlong down the hall,
wheeling into the slaughter, slashing left and right
and grisly screams broke from skulls cracked open—
the whole floor awash with blood.
Leodes now—
he flung himself at Odysseus, clutched his knees,
crying out to the king with a sudden, winging prayer:
“I hug your knees, Odysseus—mercy! spare my life!
Never, I swear, did I harass any woman in your house—
never a word, a gesture—nothing, no, I tried
to restrain the suitors, whoever did such things.
They wouldn’t listen, keep their hands to themselves—
so reckless, so they earn their shameful fate.
But I was just their prophet—
my hands are clean—and I’m to die their death!
Look at the thanks I get for years of service!”
A killing look, and the wry soldier answered,
“Only a priest, a prophet for this mob, you say?
How hard you must have prayed in my own house
that the heady day of my return would never dawn—
my dear wife would be yours, would bear your children!
For that there’s no escape from grueling death—you die!”
And snatching up in one powerful hand a sword
left on the ground—Agelaus dropped it when he fell—
Odysseus hacked the prophet square across the neck
and the praying head went tumbling in the dust.
Now one was left,
trying still to escape black death. Phemius, Terpis’ son,
the bard who always performed among the suitors—
they forced the man to sing …
There he stood, backing into the side-door,
still clutching his ringing lyre in his hands,
his mind in turmoil, torn—what should he do now?
Steal from the hall and crouch at the altar-stone
of Zeus who Guards the Court, where time and again
Odysseus and Laertes burned the long thighs of oxen?
Or throw himself on the master’s mercy, clasp his knees?
That was the better way—or so it struck him, yes,
grasp the knees of Laertes’ royal son. And so,
cradling his hollow lyre, he laid it on the ground
between the mixing-bowl and the silver-studded throne,
then rushed up to Odysseus, yes, and clutched his knees,
singing out to his king with a stirring, winged prayer:
“I hug your knees, Odysseus—mercy! spare my life!
What a grief it will be to you for all the years to come
if you kill the singer now, who sings for gods and men.
I taught myself the craft, but a god has planted
deep in my spirit all the paths of song—
songs I’m fit to sing for you as for a god.
Calm your bloodlust now—don’t take my head!
He’d bear me out, your own dear son Telemachus—
never of my own will, never for any gain did I
perform in your house, singing after the suitors
had their feasts. They were too strong, too many—
they forced me to come and sing—I had no choice!”
The inspired Prince Telemachus heard his pleas
and quickly said to his father close beside him,
“Stop, don’t cut him down! This one’s innocent.
So is the herald Medon—the one who always
tended me in the house when I was little—
spare him too. Unless he’s dead by now,
killed by Philoetius or Eumaeus here—
or ran into you rampaging through the halls.”
The herald pricked up his anxious ears at that …
cautious soul, he cowered, trembling, under a chair—
wrapped in an oxhide freshly stripped—to dodge black death.
He jumped in a flash from there, threw off the smelly hide
and scuttling up to Telemachus, clutching his knees,
the herald begged for life in words that fluttered:
“Here I am, dear boy—spare me! Tell your father,
flushed with victory, not to kill me with his sword—
enraged as he is with these young lords who bled
his palace white and showed you no respect,
the reckless fools!”
Breaking into a smile
the canny Odysseus reassured him, “Courage!
The prince has pulled you through, he’s saved you now
so you can take it to heart and tell the next man too:
clearly doing good puts doing bad to shame.
Now leave the palace, go and sit outside—
out in the courtyard, clear of the slaughter—
you and the bard with all his many songs.
Wait till I’ve done some household chores
that call for my attention.”
The two men scurried out of the house at once
and crouched at the altar-stone of mighty Zeus—
glancing left and right,
fearing death would strike at any moment.
Odysseus scanned his house to see if any man
still skulked alive, still hoped to avoid black death.
But he found them one and all in blood and dust …
great hauls of them down and out like fish that fishermen
drag from the churning gray surf in looped and coiling nets
and fling ashore on a sweeping hook of beach—some noble catch
heaped on the sand, twitching, lusting for fresh salt sea
but the Sungod hammers down and burns their lives out …
so the suitors lay in heaps, corpse covering corpse.
At last the seasoned fighter turned to his son:
“Telemachus, go, call the old nurse here—
I must tell her all that’s on my mind.”
Telemachus ran to do his father’s bidding,
shook the women’s doors, calling Eurycleia:
“Come out now! Up with you, good old woman!
You who watch over all the household hands—
quick, my father wants you, needs to have a word!”
Crisp command that left the old nurse hushed—
she spread the doors to the well-constructed hall,
slipped out in haste, and the prince led her on …
She found Odysseus in the thick of slaughtered corpses,
splattered with bloody filth like a lion that’s devoured
some ox of the field and lopes home, covered with blood,
his chest streaked, both jaws glistening, dripping red—
a sight to strike terror. So Odysseus looked now,
splattered with gore, his thighs, his fighting hands,
and she, when she saw the corpses, all the pooling blood,
was about to lift a cry of triumph—here was a great exploit,
look—but the soldier held her back and checked her zeal
with warnings winging home: “Rejoice in your heart,
old woman—peace! No cries of triumph now.
It’s unholy to glory over the bodies of the dead.
These men the doom of the gods has brought low,
and their own indecent acts. They’d no regard
for any man on earth—good or bad—
who chanced to come their way. And so, thanks
to their reckless work, they met this shameful fate.
Quick, report in full on the women in my halls—
who are disloyal to me, who are guiltless?”
“Surely, child,”
his fond old nurse replied, “now here’s the truth.
Fifty women you have inside your house,
women we’ve trained to do their duties well,
to card the wool and bear the yoke of service.
Some dozen in all went tramping to their shame,
thumbing their noses at me, at the queen herself!
And Telemachus, just now come of age—his mother
would never let the boy take charge of the maids.
But let me climb to her well-lit room upstairs
and tell your wife the news—
some god has put the woman fast asleep.”
“Don’t wake her yet,” the crafty man returned,
“you tell those women to hurry here at once—
just the ones who’ve shamed us all along.”
Away the old nurse bustled through the house
to give the women orders, rush them to the king.
Odysseus called Telemachus over, both herdsmen too,
with strict commands: “Start clearing away the bodies.
Make the women pitch in too. Chairs and tables—
scrub them down with sponges, rinse them clean.
And once you’ve put the entire house in order,
march the women out of the great hall—between
the roundhouse and the courtyard’s strong stockade—
and hack them with your swords, slash out all their lives—
blot out of their minds the joys of love they relished
under the suitors’ bodies, rutting on the sly!”
The women crowded in, huddling all together …
wailing convulsively, streaming live warm tears.
First they carried out the bodies of the dead
and propped them under the courtyard colonnade,
standing them one against another. Odysseus
shouted commands himself, moving things along,
and they kept bearing out the bodies—they were forced.
Next they scrubbed down the elegant chairs and tables,
washed them with sopping sponges, rinsed them clean.
Then Telemachus and the herdsmen scraped smooth
the packed earth floor of the royal house with spades
as the women gathered up the filth and piled it outside.
And then, at last, once the entire house was put in order,
they marched the women out of the great hall—between
the roundhouse and the courtyard’s strong stockade—
crammed them into a dead end, no way out from there,
and stern Telemachus gave the men their orders:
“No clean death for the likes of them, by god!
Not from me—they showered abuse on my head,
my mother’s too!
You sluts—the suitors’ whores!”
With that, taking a cable used on a dark-prowed ship
he coiled it over the roundhouse, lashed it fast to a tall column,
hoisting it up so high no toes could touch the ground.
Then, as doves or thrushes beating their spread wings
against some snare rigged up in thickets—flying in
for a cozy nest but a grisly bed receives them—
so the women’s heads were trapped in a line,
nooses yanking their necks up, one by one
so all might die a pitiful, ghastly death …
they kicked up heels for a little—not for long.
Melanthius?
They hauled him out through the doorway, into the court,
lopped his nose and ears with a ruthless knife,
tore his genitals out for the dogs to eat raw
and in manic fury hacked off hands and feet.
Then,
once they’d washed their own hands and feet,
they went inside again to join Odysseus.
Their work was done with now.
But the king turned to devoted Eurycleia, saying,
“Bring sulfur, nurse, to scour all this pollution—
bring me fire too, so I can fumigate the house.
And call Penelope here with all her women—
tell all the maids to come back in at once.”
“Well said, my boy,” his old nurse replied,
“right to the point. But wait,
let me fetch you a shirt and cloak to wrap you.
No more dawdling round the palace, nothing but rags
to cover those broad shoulders—it’s a scandal!”
“Fire first,” the good soldier answered.
“Light me a fire to purify this house.”
The devoted nurse snapped to his command,
brought her master fire and brimstone. Odysseus
purged his palace, halls and court, with cleansing fumes.
Then back through the royal house the old nurse went
to tell the women the news and bring them in at once.
They came crowding out of their quarters, torch in hand,
flung their arms around Odysseus, hugged him, home at last,
and kissed his head and shoulders, seized his hands, and he,
overcome by a lovely longing, broke down and wept …
deep in his heart he knew them one and all.
Book XXIII
The Great
Rooted Bed
Up to the rooms the old nurse clambered, chuckling all the way,
to tell the queen her husband was here now, home at last.
Her knees bustling, feet shuffling over each other,
till hovering at her mistress’ head she spoke:
“Penelope—child—wake up and see for yourself,
with your own eyes, all you dreamed of, all your days!
He’s here—Odysseus—he’s come home, at long last!
He’s killed the suitors, swaggering young brutes
who plagued his house, wolfed his cattle down,
rode roughshod over his son!”
“Dear old nurse,” wary Penelope replied,
“the gods have made you mad. They have that power,
putting lunacy into the clearest head around
or setting a half-wit on the path to sense.
They’ve unhinged you, and you were once so sane.
Why do you mock me?—haven’t I wept enough?—
telling such wild stories, interrupting my sleep,
sweet sleep that held me, sealed my eyes just now.
Not once have I slept so soundly since the day
Odysseus sailed away to see that cursed city …
Destroy, I call it—I hate to say its name!
Now down you go. Back to your own quarters.
If any other woman of mine had come to me,
rousing me out of sleep with such a tale,
I’d have her bundled back to her room in pain.
It’s only your old gray head that spares you that!”
“Never”—the fond old nurse kept pressing on—
“dear child, I’d never mock you! No, it’s all true,
he’s here—Odysseus—he’s come home, just as I tell you!
He’s the stranger they all manhandled in the hall.
Telemachus knew he was here, for days and days,
but he knew enough to hide his father’s plans
so he could pay those vipers back in kind!”
Penelope’s heart burst in joy, she leapt from bed,
her eyes streaming tears, she hugged the old nurse
and cried out with an eager, winging word,
“Please, dear one, give me the whole story.
If he’s really home again, just as you tell me,
how did he get those shameless suitors in his clutches?—
single-handed, braving an army always camped inside.”
“I have no idea,” the devoted nurse replied.
“I didn’t see it, I didn’t ask—all I heard
was the choking groans of men cut down in blood.
We crouched in terror—a dark nook of our quarters—
all of us locked tight behind those snug doors
till your boy Telemachus came and called me out—
his father rushed him there to do just that. Then
I found Odysseus in the thick of slaughtered corpses;
there he stood and all around him, over the beaten floor,
the bodies sprawled in heaps, lying one on another …
How it would have thrilled your heart to see him—
splattered with bloody filth, a lion with his kill!
And now they’re all stacked at the courtyard gates—
he’s lit a roaring fire,
he’s purifying the house with cleansing fumes
and he’s sent me here to bring you back to him.
Follow me down! So now, after all the years of grief,
you two can embark, loving hearts, along the road to joy.
Look, your dreams, put off so long, come true at last—
he’s back alive, home at his hearth, and found you,
found his son still here. And all those suitors
who did him wrong, he’s paid them back, he has,
right in his own house!”
“Hush, dear woman,”
guarded Penelope cautioned her at once.
“Don’t laugh, don’t cry in triumph—not yet.
You know how welcome the sight of him would be
to all in the house, and to me most of all
and the son we bore together.
But the story can’t be true, not as you tell it,
no, it must be a god who’s killed our brazen friends—
up in arms at their outrage, heartbreaking crimes.
They’d no regard for any man on earth—
good or bad—who chanced to come their way. So,
thanks to their reckless work they die their deaths.
Odysseus? Far from Achaea now, he’s lost all hope
of coming home … he’s lost and gone himself.”
“Child,” the devoted old nurse protested,
“what nonsense you let slip through your teeth.
Here’s your husband, warming his hands at his own hearth,
here—and you, you say he’ll never come home again,
always the soul of trust! All right, this too—
I’ll give you a sign, a proof that’s plain as day.
That scar, made years ago by a boar’s white tusk—
I spotted the scar myself, when I washed his feet,
and I tried to tell you, ah, but he, the crafty rascal,
clamped his hand on my mouth—I couldn’t say a word.
Follow me down now. I’ll stake my life on it:
if I am lying to you—
kill me with a thousand knives of pain!”
“Dear old nurse,” composed Penelope responded,
“deep as you are, my friend, you’ll find it hard
to plumb the plans of the everlasting gods.
All the same, let’s go and join my son
so I can see the suitors lying dead
and see … the one who killed them.”
With that thought
Penelope started down from her lofty room, her heart
in turmoil, torn … should she keep her distance,
probe her husband? Or rush up to the man at once
and kiss his head and cling to both his hands?
As soon as she stepped across the stone threshold,
slipping in, she took a seat at the closest wall
and radiant in the firelight, faced Odysseus now.
There he sat, leaning against the great central column,
eyes fixed on the ground, waiting, poised for whatever words
his hardy wife might say when she caught sight of him.
A long while she sat in silence … numbing wonder
filled her heart as her eyes explored his face.
One moment he seemed … Odysseus, to the life—
the next, no, he was not the man she knew,
a huddled mass of rags was all she saw.
“Oh mother,” Telemachus reproached her,
“cruel mother, you with your hard heart!
Why do you spurn my father so—why don’t you
sit beside him, engage him, ask him questions?
What other wife could have a spirit so unbending?
Holding back from her husband, home at last for her
after bearing twenty years of brutal struggle—
your heart was always harder than a rock!”
“My child,”
Penelope, well-aware, explained, “I’m stunned with wonder,
powerless. Cannot speak to him, ask him questions,
look him in the eyes … But if he is truly
Odysseus, home at last, make no mistake:
we two will know each other, even better—
we two have secret signs,
known to us both but hidden from the world.”
Odysseus, long-enduring, broke into a smile
and turned to his son with pointed, winging words:
“Leave your mother here in the hall to test me
as she will. She soon will know me better.
Now because I am filthy, wear such grimy rags,
she spurns me—your mother still can’t bring herself
to believe I am her husband.
But you and I,
put heads together. What’s our best defense?
When someone kills a lone man in the realm
who leaves behind him no great band of avengers,
still the killer flees, goodbye to kin and country.
But we brought down the best of the island’s princes,
the pillars of Ithaca. Weigh it well, I urge you.”
“Look to it all yourself now, father,” his son
deferred at once. “You are the best on earth,
they say, when it comes to mapping tactics.
No one, no mortal man, can touch you there.
But we’re behind you, hearts intent on battle,
nor do I think you’ll find us short on courage,
long as our strength will last.”
“Then here’s our plan,”
the master of tactics said. “I think it’s best.
First go and wash, and pull fresh tunics on,
and tell the maids in the hall to dress well too.
And let the inspired bard take up his ringing lyre
and lead off for us all a dance so full of heart
that whoever hears the strains outside the gates—
a passerby on the road, a neighbor round about—
will think it’s a wedding-feast that’s under way.
No news of the suitors’ death must spread through town
till we have slipped away to our own estates,
our orchard green with trees. There we’ll see
what winning strategy Zeus will hand us then.”
They hung on his words and moved to orders smartly.
First they washed and pulled fresh tunics on,
the women arrayed themselves—the inspired bard
struck up his resounding lyre and stirred in all
a desire for dance and song, the lovely lilting beat,
till the great house echoed round to the measured tread
of dancing men in motion, women sashed and lithe.
And whoever heard the strains outside would say,
“A miracle—someone’s married the queen at last!”
“One of her hundred suitors.”
“That callous woman,
too faithless to keep her lord and master’s house
to the bitter end—”
“Till he came sailing home.”
So they’d say, blind to what had happened:
the great-hearted Odysseus was home again at last.
The maid Eurynome bathed him, rubbed him down with oil
and drew around him a royal cape and choice tunic too.
And Athena crowned the man with beauty, head to foot,
made him taller to all eyes, his build more massive,
yes, and down from his brow the great goddess
ran his curls like thick hyacinth clusters
full of blooms. As a master craftsman washes
gold over beaten silver—a man the god of fire
and Queen Athena trained in every fine technique—
and finishes of his latest effort, handsome work …
so she lavished splendor over his head and shoulders now.
He stepped from his bath, glistening like a god,
and back he went to the seat that he had left
and facing his wife, declared,
“Strange woman! So hard—the gods of Olympus
made you harder than any other woman in the world!
What other wife could have a spirit so unbending?
Holding back from her husband, home at last for her
after bearing twenty years of brutal struggle.
Come, nurse, make me a bed, I’ll sleep alone.
She has a heart of iron in her breast.”
“Strange man,”
wary Penelope said. “I’m not so proud, so scornful,
nor am I overwhelmed by your quick change …
You look—how well I know—the way he looked,
setting sail from Ithaca years ago
aboard the long-oared ship.
Come, Eurycleia,
move the sturdy bedstead out of our bridal chamber—
that room the master built with his own hands.
Take it out now, sturdy bed that it is,
and spread it deep with fleece,
blankets and lustrous throws to keep him warm.”
Putting her husband to the proof—but Odysseus
blazed up in fury, lashing out at his loyal wife:
“Woman—your words, they cut me to the core!
Who could move my bed? Impossible task,
even for some skilled craftsman—unless a god
came down in person, quick to lend a hand,
lifted it out with ease and moved it elsewhere.
Not a man on earth, not even at peak strength,
would find it easy to prise it up and shift it, no,
a great sign, a hallmark lies in its construction.
I know, I built it myself—no one else …
There was a branching olive-tree inside our court,
grown to its full prime, the bole like a column, thickset.
Around it I built my bedroom, finished off the walls
with good tight stonework, roofed it over soundly
and added doors, hung well and snugly wedged.
Then I lopped the leafy crown of the olive,
clean-cutting the stump bare from roots up,
planing it round with a bronze smoothing-adze—
I had the skill—I shaped it plumb to the line to make
my bedpost, bored the holes it needed with an auger.
Working from there I built my bed, start to finish,
I gave it ivory inlays, gold and silver fittings,
wove the straps across it, oxhide gleaming red.
There’s our secret sign, I tell you, our life story!
Does the bed, my lady, still stand planted firm?—
I don’t know—or has someone chopped away
that olive-trunk and hauled our bedstead off?”
Living proof—
Penelope felt her knees go slack, her heart surrender,
recognizing the strong clear signs Odysseus offered.
She dissolved in tears, rushed to Odysseus, flung her arms
around his neck and kissed his head and cried out,
“Odysseus—don’t flare up at me now, not you,
always the most understanding man alive!
The gods, it was the gods who sent us sorrow—
they grudged us both a life in each other’s arms
from the heady zest of youth to the stoop of old age.
But don’t fault me, angry with me now because I failed,
at the first glimpse, to greet you, hold you, so …
In my heart of hearts I always cringed with fear
some fraud might come, beguile me with his talk;
the world is full of the sort,
cunning ones who plot their own dark ends.
Remember Helen of Argos, Zeus’s daughter—
would she have sported so in a stranger’s bed
if she had dreamed that Achaea’s sons were doomed
to fight and die to bring her home again?
Some god spurred her to do her shameless work.
Not till then did her mind conceive that madness,
blinding madness that caused her anguish, ours as well.
But now, since you have revealed such overwhelming proof—
the secret sign of our bed, which no one’s ever seen
but you and I and a single handmaid, Actoris,
the servant my father gave me when I came,
who kept the doors of our room you built so well …
you’ve conquered my heart, my hard heart, at last!”
The more she spoke, the more a deep desire for tears
welled up inside his breast—he wept as he held the wife
he loved, the soul of loyalty, in his arms at last.
Joy, warm as the joy that shipwrecked sailors feel
when they catch sight of land—Poseidon has struck
their well-rigged ship on the open sea with gale winds
and crushing walls of waves, and only a few escape, swimming,
struggling out of the frothing surf to reach the shore,
their bodies crusted with salt but buoyed up with joy
as they plant their feet on solid ground again,
spared a deadly fate. So joyous now to her
the sight of her husband, vivid in her gaze,
that her white arms, embracing his neck
would never for a moment let him go …
Dawn with her rose-red fingers might have shone
upon their tears, if with her glinting eyes
Athena had not thought of one more thing.
She held back the night, and night lingered long
at the western edge of the earth, while in the east
she reined in Dawn of the golden throne at Ocean’s banks,
commanding her not to yoke the windswift team that brings men light,
Blaze and Aurora, the young colts that race the Morning on.
Yet now Odysseus, seasoned veteran, said to his wife,
“Dear woman … we have still not reached the end
of all our trials. One more labor lies in store—
boundless, laden with danger, great and long,
and I must brave it out from start to finish.
So the ghost of Tiresias prophesied to me,
the day that I went down to the House of Death
to learn our best route home, my comrades’ and my own.
But come, let’s go to bed, dear woman—at long last
delight in sleep, delight in each other, come!”
“If it’s bed you want,” reserved Penelope replied,
“it’s bed you’ll have, whenever the spirit moves,
now that the gods have brought you home again
to native land, your grand and gracious house.
But since you’ve alluded to it,
since a god has put it in your mind,
please, tell me about this trial still to come.
I’m bound to learn of it later, I am sure—
what’s the harm if I hear of it tonight?”
“Still so strange,”
Odysseus, the old master of stories, answered.
“Why again, why force me to tell you all?
Well, tell I shall. I’ll hide nothing now.
But little joy it will bring you, I’m afraid,
as little joy for me.
The prophet said
that I must rove through towns on towns of men,
that I must carry a well-planed oar until
I come to a people who know nothing of the sea,
whose food is never seasoned with salt, strangers all
to ships with their crimson prows and long slim oars,
wings that make ships fly. And here is my sign,
he told me, clear, so clear I cannot miss it,
and I will share it with you now …
When another traveler falls in with me and calls
that weight across my shoulder a fan to winnow grain,
then, he told me, I must plant my oar in the earth
and sacrifice fine beasts to the lord god of the sea,
Poseidon—a ram, a bull and a ramping wild boar—
then journey home and render noble offerings up
to the deathless gods who rule the vaulting skies,
to all the gods in order.
And at last my own death will steal upon me …
a gentle, painless death, far from the sea it comes
to take me down, borne down with the years in ripe old age
with all my people here in blessed peace around me.
All this, the prophet said, will come to pass.”
“And so,” Penelope said, in her great wisdom,
“if the gods will really grant a happier old age,
there’s hope that we’ll escape our trials at last.”
So husband and wife confided in each other,
while nurse and Eurynome, under the flaring brands,
were making up the bed with coverings deep and soft.
And working briskly, soon as they’d made it snug,
back to her room the old nurse went to sleep
as Eurynome, their attendant, torch in hand,
lighted the royal couple’s way to bed and,
leading them to their chamber, slipped away.
Rejoicing in each other, they returned to their bed,
the old familiar place they loved so well.
Now Telemachus, the cowherd and the swineherd
rested their dancing feet and had the women do the same,
and across the shadowed hall the men lay down to sleep.
But the royal couple, once they’d reveled in all
the longed-for joys of love, reveled in each other’s stories,
the radiant woman telling of all she’d borne at home,
watching them there, the infernal crowd of suitors
slaughtering herds of cattle and good fat sheep—
while keen to win her hand—
draining the broached vats dry of vintage wine.
And great Odysseus told his wife of all the pains
he had dealt out to other men and all the hardships
he’d endured himself—his story first to last—
and she listened on, enchanted …
Sleep never sealed her eyes till all was told.
He launched in with how he fought the Cicones down,
then how he came to the Lotus-eaters’ lush green land.
Then all the crimes of the Cyclops and how he paid him back
for the gallant men the monster ate without a qualm—
then how he visited Aeolus, who gave him a hero’s welcome
then he sent him off, but the homeward run was not his fate,
not yet—some sudden squalls snatched him away once more
and drove him over the swarming sea, groaning in despair.
Then how he moored at Telepylus, where Laestrygonians
wrecked his fleet and killed his men-at-arms.
He told her of Circe’s cunning magic wiles
and how he voyaged down in his long benched ship
to the moldering House of Death, to consult Tiresias,
ghostly seer of Thebes, and he saw old comrades there
and he saw his mother, who bore and reared him as a child.
He told how he caught the Sirens’ voices throbbing in the wind
and how he had scudded past the Clashing Rocks, past grim Charybdis,
past Scylla—whom no rover had ever coasted by, home free—
and how his shipmates slaughtered the cattle of the Sun
and Zeus the king of thunder split his racing ship
with a reeking bolt and killed his hardy comrades,
all his fighting men at a stroke, but he alone
escaped their death at sea. He told how he reached
Ogygia’s shores and the nymph Calypso held him back,
deep in her arching caverns, craving him for a husband—
cherished him, vowed to make him immortal, ageless, all his days,
yes, but she never won the heart inside him, never …
then how he reached the Phaeacians—heavy sailing there—
who with all their hearts had prized him like a god
and sent him off in a ship to his own beloved land,
giving him bronze and hoards of gold and robes …
and that was the last he told her, just as sleep
overcame him … sleep loosing his limbs,
slipping the toils of anguish from his mind.
Athena, her eyes afire, had fresh plans.
Once she thought he’d had his heart’s content
of love and sleep at his wife’s side, straightaway
she roused young Dawn from Ocean’s banks to her golden throne
to bring men light and roused Odysseus too, who rose
from his soft bed and advised his wife in parting,
“Dear woman, we both have had our fill of trials.
You in our house, weeping over my journey home,
fraught with storms and torment, true, and I,
pinned down in pain by Zeus and other gods,
for all my desire, blocked from reaching home.
But now that we’ve arrived at our bed together—
the reunion that we yearned for all those years—
look after the things still left me in our house.
But as for the flocks those strutting suitors plundered,
much I’ll recoup myself, making many raids;
the rest our fellow-Ithacans will supply
till all my folds are full of sheep again.
But now I must be off to the upland farm,
our orchard green with trees, to see my father,
good old man weighed down with so much grief for me.
And you, dear woman, sensible as you are,
I would advise you, still …
quick as the rising sun the news will spread
of the suitors that I killed inside the house.
So climb to your lofty chamber with your women.
Sit tight there. See no one. Question no one.”
He strapped his burnished armor round his shoulders,
roused Telemachus, the cowherd and the swineherd,
and told them to take up weapons honed for battle.
They snapped to commands, harnessed up in bronze,
opened the doors and strode out, Odysseus in the lead.
By now the daylight covered the land, but Pallas,
shrouding them all in darkness,
quickly led the four men out of town.
