Book XX
Portents Gather
Off in the entrance-hall the great king made his bed,
spreading out on the ground the raw hide of an ox,
heaping over it fleece from sheep the suitors
butchered day and night, then Eurynome threw
a blanket over him, once he’d nestled down.
And there Odysseus lay …
plotting within himself the suitors’ death—
awake, alert, as the women slipped from the house,
the maids who whored in the suitors’ beds each night,
tittering, linking arms and frisking as before.
The master’s anger rose inside his chest,
torn in thought, debating, head and heart—
should he up and rush them, kill them one and all
or let them rut with their lovers one last time?
The heart inside him growled low with rage,
as a bitch mounting over her weak, defenseless puppies
growls, facing a stranger, bristling for a showdown—
so he growled from his depths, hackles rising at their outrage.
But he struck his chest and curbed his fighting heart:
“Bear up, old heart! You’ve borne worse, far worse,
that day when the Cyclops, man-mountain, bolted
your hardy comrades down. But you held fast—
Nobody but your cunning pulled you through
the monster’s cave you thought would be your death.”
So he forced his spirit into submission,
the rage in his breast reined back—unswerving,
all endurance. But he himself kept tossing, turning,
intent as a cook before some white-hot blazing fire
who rolls his sizzling sausage back and forth,
packed with fat and blood—keen to broil it quickly,
tossing, turning it, this way, that way—so he cast about:
how could he get these shameless suitors in his clutches,
one man facing a mob? … when close to his side she came,
Athena sweeping down from the sky in a woman’s build
and hovering at his head, the goddess spoke:
“Why still awake? The unluckiest man alive!
Here is your house, your wife at home, your son,
as fine a boy as one could hope to have.”
“True,”
the wily fighter replied, “how right you are, goddess,
but still this worry haunts me, heart and soul—
how can I get these shameless suitors in my clutches?
Single-handed, braving an army always camped inside.
There’s another worry, that haunts me even more.
What if I kill them—thanks to you and Zeus—
how do I run from under their avengers?
Show me the way, I ask you.”
“Impossible man!”
Athena bantered, the goddess’ eyes ablaze.
“Others are quick to trust a weaker comrade,
some poor mortal, far less cunning than I.
But I am a goddess, look, the very one who
guards you in all your trials to the last.
I tell you this straight out:
even if fifty bands of mortal fighters
closed around us, hot to kill us off in battle,
still you could drive away their herds and sleek flocks!
So, surrender to sleep at last. What a misery,
keeping watch through the night, wide awake—
you’ll soon come up from under all your troubles.”
With that she showered sleep across his eyes
and back to Olympus went the lustrous goddess.
As soon as sleep came on him, loosing his limbs,
slipping the toils of anguish from his mind,
his devoted wife awoke and,
sitting up in her soft bed, returned to tears.
When the queen had wept to her heart’s content
she prayed to the Huntress, Artemis, first of all:
“Artemis—goddess, noble daughter of Zeus, if only
you’d whip an arrow through my breast and tear my life out,
now, at once! Or let some whirlwind pluck me up
and sweep me away along those murky paths and
fling me down where the Ocean River running
round the world rolls back upon itself!
Quick
as the whirlwinds swept away Pandareus’ daughters—
years ago, when the gods destroyed their parents,
leaving the young girls orphans in their house.
But radiant Aphrodite nursed them well
on cheese and luscious honey and heady wine,
and Hera gave them beauty and sound good sense,
more than all other women—virgin Artemis made them tall
and Athena honed their skills to fashion lovely work.
But then, when Aphrodite approached Olympus’ peaks
to ask for the girls their crowning day as brides
from Zeus who loves the lightning—Zeus who knows all,
all that’s fated, all not fated, for mortal man—
then the storm spirits snatched them away
and passed them on to the hateful Furies,
yes, for all their loving care.
Just so
may the gods who rule Olympus blot me out!
Artemis with your glossy braids, come shoot me dead—
so I can plunge beneath this loathsome earth
with the image of Odysseus vivid in my mind.
Never let me warm the heart of a weaker man!
Even grief is bearable, true, when someone weeps
through the days, sobbing, heart convulsed with pain,
yet embraced by sleep all night—sweet oblivion, sleep
dissolving all, the good and the bad, once it seals our eyes—
but even my dreams torment me, sent by wicked spirits.
Again—just this night—someone lay beside me …
like Odysseus to the life, when he embarked
with his men-at-arms. My heart raced with joy.
No dream, I thought, the waking truth at last!”
At those words
Dawn rose on her golden throne in a sudden gleam of light.
And great Odysseus caught the sound of his wife’s cry
and began to daydream—deep in his heart it seemed
she stood beside him, knew him, now, at last …
Gathering up the fleece and blankets where he’d slept,
he laid them on a chair in the hall, he took the oxhide out
and spread it down, lifted his hands and prayed to Zeus:
“Father Zeus, if you really willed it so—to bring me
home over land and sea-lanes, home to native ground
after all the pain you brought me—show me a sign,
a good omen voiced by someone awake indoors,
another sign, outside, from Zeus himself!”
And Zeus in all his wisdom heard that prayer.
He thundered at once, out of his clear blue heavens
high above the clouds, and Odysseus’ spirit lifted.
Then from within the halls a woman grinding grain
let fly a lucky word. Close at hand she was,
where the good commander set the handmills once
and now twelve women in all performed their tasks,
grinding the wheat and barley, marrow of men’s bones.
The rest were abed by now—they’d milled their stint—
this one alone, the frailest of all, kept working on.
Stopping her mill, she spoke an omen for her master:
“Zeus, Father! King of gods and men, now there
was a crack of thunder out of the starry sky—
and not a cloud in sight!
Sure it’s a sign you’re showing someone now.
So, poor as I am, grant me my prayer as well:
let this day be the last, the last these suitors
bolt their groaning feasts in King Odysseus’ house!
These brutes who break my knees—heart-wrenching labor,
grinding their grain—now let them eat their last!”
A lucky omen, linked with Zeus’s thunder.
Odysseus’ heart leapt up, the man convinced
he’d grind the scoundrels’ lives out in revenge.
By now
the other maids were gathering in Odysseus’ royal palace,
raking up on the hearth the fire still going strong.
Telemachus climbed from bed and dressed at once,
brisk as a young god—
over his shoulder he slung his well-honed sword,
he fastened rawhide sandals under his smooth feet,
he seized his tough spear tipped with a bronze point
and took his stand at the threshold, calling Eurycleia:
“Dear nurse, how did you treat the stranger in our house?
With bed and board? Or leave him to lie untended?
That would be mother’s way—sensible as she is—
all impulse, doting over some worthless stranger,
turning a good man out to face the worst.”
“Please, child,” his calm old nurse replied,
“don’t blame her—your mother’s blameless this time.
He sat and drank his wine till he’d had his fill.
Food? He’d lost his hunger. But she asked him.
And when it was time to think of turning in,
she told the maids to spread a decent bed, but he—
so down-and-out, poor soul, so dogged by fate—
said no to snuggling into a bed, between covers.
No sir, the man lay down in the entrance-hall,
on the raw hide of an ox and sheep’s fleece,
and we threw a blanket over him, so we did.”
Hearing that,
Telemachus strode out through the palace, spear in hand,
and a pair of sleek hounds went trotting at his heels.
He made for the meeting grounds to join the island lords
while Eurycleia the daughter of Ops, Pisenor’s son,
that best of women, gave the maids their orders:
“Quick now, look alive, sweep out the house,
wet down the floors!
You, those purple coverlets,
fling them over the fancy chairs!
All those tables,
sponge them down—scour the winebowls, burnished cups!
The rest—now off you go to the spring and fetch some water,
fast as your legs can run!
Our young gallants won’t be long from the palace,
they’ll be bright and early—today’s a public feast.”
They hung on her words and ran to do her bidding.
Full twenty scurried off to the spring’s dark water,
others bent to the housework, all good hands.
Then in they trooped, the strutting serving-men,
who split the firewood cleanly now as the women
bustled in from the spring, the swineherd at their heels,
driving three fat porkers, the best of all his herds.
And leaving them to root in the broad courtyard,
up he went to Odysseus, hailed him warmly:
“Friend, do the suitors show you more respect
or treat you like the dregs of the earth as always?”
“Good Eumaeus,” the crafty man replied,
“if only the gods would pay back their outrage!
Wild and reckless young cubs, conniving here
in another’s house. They’ve got no sense of shame.”
And now as the two confided in each other,
the goatherd Melanthius sauntered toward them,
herding his goats with a pair of drovers’ help,
the pick of his flocks to make the suitors’ meal.
Under the echoing porch he tethered these, then turned
on Odysseus once again with cutting insults: “Still alive?
Still hounding your betters, begging round the house?
Why don’t you cart yourself away? Get out!
We’ll never part, I swear,
till we taste each other’s fists. Riffraff,
you and your begging make us sick! Get out—
we’re hardly the only banquet on the island.”
No reply. The wily one just shook his head,
silent, his mind churning with thoughts of bloody work …
Third to arrive was Philoetius, that good cowherd,
prodding in for the crowd a heifer and fat goats.
Boatmen had brought them over from the mainland,
crews who ferry across all travelers too,
whoever comes for passage.
Under the echoing porch he tethered all heads well
and then approached the swineherd, full of questions:
“Who’s this stranger, Eumaeus, just come to the house?
What roots does the man claim—who are his people?
Where are his blood kin? his father’s fields?
Poor beggar. But what a build—a royal king’s!
Ah, once the gods weave trouble into our lives
they drive us across the earth, they drown us all in pain,
even kings of the realm.”
And with that thought
he walked up to Odysseus, gave him his right hand
and winged a greeting: “Cheers, old friend, old father,
here’s to your luck, great days from this day on—
saddled now as you are with so much trouble!
Father Zeus, no god’s more deadly than you.
No mercy for men, you give them life yourself
then plunge them into misery, brutal hardship.
I broke into sweat, my friend, when I first saw you—
see, my eyes still brim with tears, remembering him,
Odysseus … He must wear such rags, I know it,
knocking about, drifting through the world
if he’s still alive and sees the light of day.
If he’s dead already, lost in the House of Death,
my heart aches for Odysseus, my great lord and master.
He set me in charge of his herds, in Cephallenian country,
when I was just a youngster. How they’ve grown by now,
past counting! No mortal on earth could breed
a finer stock of oxen—broad in the brow,
they thrive like ears of corn. But just look,
these interlopers tell me to drive them in
for their own private feasts. Not a thought
for the young prince in the house, they never flinch—
no regard for the gods’ wrath—in their mad rush
to carve up his goods, my master gone so long!
I’m tossed from horn to horn in my own mind …
What a traitor I’d be, with the prince alive,
if I’d run off to some other country, herds and all,
to a new set of strangers. Ah, but isn’t it worse
to hold out here, tending the herds for upstarts,
not their owners—suffering all the pains of hell?
I could have fled, ages ago, to some great king
who’d give me shelter. It’s unbearable here.
True, but I still dream of my old master,
unlucky man—if only he’d drop in from the blue
and drive these suitors all in a rout throughout the halls!”
“Cowherd,” the cool tactician Odysseus answered,
“you’re no coward, and nobody’s fool, I’d say.
Even I can see there’s sense in that old head.
So I tell you this on my solemn, binding oath:
I swear by Zeus, the first of all the gods—
by the table of hospitality waiting for us,
by Odysseus’ hearth where I have come for help,
Odysseus will come home while you’re still here.
You’ll see with your own eyes, if you have the heart,
these suitors who lord it here cut down in blood.”
“Stranger, if only,” the cowherd cried aloud,
“if only Zeus would make that oath come true—
you’d see my power, my fighting arms in action!”
Eumaeus echoed his prayer to all the gods
that their wise king would soon come home again.
Now as they spoke and urged each other on,
and once more the suitors were plotting certain doom
for the young prince—suddenly, banking high on the left
an omen flew past, an eagle clutching a trembling dove.
And Amphinomus rose in haste to warn them all,
“My friends, we’ll never carry off this plot
to kill the prince. Let’s concentrate on feasting.”
His timely invitation pleased them all.
The suitors ambled into Odysseus’ royal house
and flinging down their cloaks on a chair or bench,
they butchered hulking sheep and fatted goats,
full-grown hogs and a young cow from the herd.
They roasted all the innards, served them round
and filled the bowls with wine and mixed it well.
Eumaeus passed out cups; Philoetius, trusty herdsman,
brought on loaves of bread in ample wicker trays;
Melanthius poured the wine. The whole company
reached out for the good things that lay at hand.
Telemachus, maneuvering shrewdly, sat his father down
on the stone threshold, just inside the timbered hall,
and set a rickety stool and cramped table there.
He gave him a share of innards, poured his wine
in a golden cup and added a bracing invitation:
“Now sit right there. Drink your wine with the crowd.
I’ll defend you from all their taunts and blows,
these young bucks. This is no public place,
this is Odysseus’ house—
my father won it for me, so it’s mine.
You suitors, control yourselves. No insults now,
no brawling, no, or it’s war between us all.”
So he declared. And they all bit their lips,
amazed the prince could speak with so much daring.
Only Eupithes’ son Antinous ventured,
“Fighting words, but do let’s knuckle under—
to our prince. Such abuse, such naked threats!
But clearly Zeus has foiled us. Or long before
we would have shut his mouth for him in the halls,
fluent and flowing as he is.”
So he mocked.
Telemachus paid no heed.
And now through the streets
the heralds passed, leading the beasts marked out
for sacrifice on Apollo’s grand festal day,
and the islanders with their long hair were filing
into the god’s shady grove—the distant deadly Archer.
Those in the palace, once they’d roasted the prime cuts,
pulled them off the spits and, sharing out the portions,
fell to the royal feast …
The men who served them gave Odysseus his share,
fair as the helping they received themselves.
So Telemachus ordered, the king’s own son.
But Athena had no mind to let the brazen suitors
hold back now from their heart-rending insults—
she meant to make the anguish cut still deeper
into the core of Laertes’ son Odysseus.
There was one among them, a lawless boor—
Ctesippus was his name, he made his home in Same,
a fellow so impressed with his own astounding wealth
he courted the wife of Odysseus, gone for years.
Now the man harangued his swaggering comrades:
“Listen to me, my fine friends, here’s what I say!
From the start our guest has had his fair share—
it’s only right, you know.
How impolite it would be, how wrong to scant
whatever guest Telemachus welcomes to his house.
Look here, I’ll give him a proper guest-gift too,
a prize he can hand the crone who bathes his feet
or a tip for another slave who haunts the halls
of our great king Odysseus!”
On that note,
grabbing an oxhoof out of a basket where it lay,
with a brawny hand he flung it straight at the king—
but Odysseus ducked his head a little, dodging the blow,
and seething just as the oxhoof hit the solid wall
he clenched his teeth in a wry sardonic grin.
Telemachus dressed Ctesippus down at once:
“Ctesippus, you can thank your lucky stars
you missed our guest—he ducked your blow, by god!
Else I would have planted my sharp spear in your bowels—
your father would have been busy with your funeral,
not your wedding here. Enough.
Don’t let me see more offenses in my house,
not from anyone! I’m alive to it all, now,
the good and the bad—the boy you knew is gone.
But I still must bear with this, this lovely sight …
sheepflocks butchered, wine swilled, food squandered—
how can a man fight off so many single-handed?
But no more of your crimes against me, please!
Unless you’re bent on cutting me down, now,
and I’d rather die, yes, better that by far
than have to look on at your outrage day by day:
guests treated to blows, men dragging the serving-women
through our noble house, exploiting them all, no shame!”
Dead quiet. The suitors all fell silent, hushed.
At last Damastor’s son Agelaus rose and said,
“Fair enough, my friends; when a man speaks well
we have no grounds for wrangling, no cause for abuse.
Hands off this stranger! Or any other servant
in King Odysseus’ palace. But now a word
of friendly advice for Telemachus and his mother—
here’s hoping it proves congenial to them both.
So long as your hearts still kept a spark alive
that Odysseus would return—that great, deep man—
who could blame you, playing the waiting game at home
and holding off the suitors? The better course, it’s true.
What if Odysseus had returned, had made it home at last?
But now it’s clear as day—the man will come no more.
So go, Telemachus, sit with your mother, coax her
to wed the best man here, the one who offers most,
so you can have and hold your father’s estate,
eating and drinking here, your mind at peace
while mother plays the wife in another’s house.”
The young prince, keeping his poise, replied,
“I swear by Zeus, Agelaus, by all my father suffered—
dead, no doubt, or wandering far from Ithaca these days—
I don’t delay my mother’s marriage, not a moment,
I press her to wed the man who takes her heart.
I’ll shower her myself with boundless gifts.
But I shrink from driving mother from our house,
issuing harsh commands against her will.
God forbid it ever comes to that!”
So he vowed
and Athena set off uncontrollable laughter in the suitors,
crazed them out of their minds—mad, hysterical laughter
seemed to break from the jaws of strangers, not their own,
and the meat they were eating oozed red with blood—
tears flooded their eyes, hearts possessed by grief.
The inspired seer Theoclymenus wailed out in their midst,
“Poor men, what terror is this that overwhelms you so?
Night shrouds your heads, your faces, down to your knees—
cries of mourning are bursting into fire—cheeks rivering tears—
the walls and the handsome crossbeams dripping dank with blood!
Ghosts, look, thronging the entrance, thronging the court,
go trooping down to the realm of death and darkness!
The sun is blotted out of the sky—look there—
a lethal mist spreads all across the earth!”
At that
they all broke into peals of laughter aimed at the seer—
Polybus’ son Eurymachus braying first and foremost,
“Our guest just in from abroad, the man is raving!
Quick, my boys, hustle him out of the house,
into the meeting grounds, the light of day—
everything here he thinks is dark as night!”
“Eurymachus,” the inspired prophet countered,
“when I want your escort, I’ll ask for it myself.
I have eyes and ears, and both my feet, still,
and a head that’s fairly sound,
nothing to be ashamed of. These will do
to take me past those doors …
Oh I can see it now—
the disaster closing on you all! There’s no escaping it,
no way out—not for a single one of you suitors,
wild reckless fools, plotting outrage here,
the halls of Odysseus, great and strong as a god!”
With that he marched out of the sturdy house
and went home to Piraeus, the host who warmed him in.
Now all the suitors, trading their snide glances, started
heckling Telemachus, made a mockery of his guests.
One or another brash young gallant scoffed,
“Telemachus, no one’s more unlucky with his guests!”
“Look what your man dragged in—this mangy tramp
scraping for bread and wine!”
“Not fit for good hard work,
the bag of bones—”
“A useless dead weight on the land!”
“And then this charlatan up and apes the prophet.”
“Take it from me—you’ll be better off by far—
toss your friends in a slave-ship—”
“Pack them off
to Sicily, fast—they’ll fetch you one sweet price!”
So they jeered, but the prince paid no attention …
silent, eyes riveted on his father, always waiting
the moment he’d lay hands on that outrageous mob.
And all the while Icarius’ daughter, wise Penelope,
had placed her carved chair within earshot, at the door,
so she could catch each word they uttered in the hall.
Laughing rowdily, men prepared their noonday meal,
succulent, rich—they’d butchered quite a herd.
But as for supper, what could be less enticing
than what a goddess and a powerful man
would spread before them soon? A groaning feast—
for they’d been first to plot their vicious crimes.
Book XXI
Odysseus Strings
His Bow
The time had come. The goddess Athena with her blazing eyes
inspired Penelope, Icarius’ daughter, wary, poised,
to set the bow and the gleaming iron axes out
before her suitors waiting in Odysseus’ hall—
to test their skill and bring their slaughter on.
Up the steep stairs to her room she climbed
and grasped in a steady hand the curved key—
fine bronze, with ivory haft attached—
and then with her chamber-women made her way
to a hidden storeroom, far in the palace depths,
and there they lay, the royal master’s treasures:
bronze, gold and a wealth of hard wrought iron
and there it lay as well … his backsprung bow
with its quiver bristling arrows, shafts of pain.
Gifts from the old days, from a friend he’d met
in Lacedaemon—Iphitus, Eurytus’ gallant son.
Once in Messene the two struck up together,
in sly Ortilochus’ house, that time Odysseus
went to collect a debt the whole realm owed him,
for Messenian raiders had lifted flocks from Ithaca,
three hundred head in their oarswept ships, the herdsmen too.
So his father and island elders sent Odysseus off,
a young boy on a mission,
a distant embassy made to right that wrong.
Iphitus went there hunting the stock that he had lost,
a dozen mares still nursing their hardy suckling mules.
The same mares that would prove his certain death
when he reached the son of Zeus, that iron heart,
Heracles—the past master of monstrous works—
who killed the man, a guest in his own house.
Brutal. Not a care for the wrathful eyes of god
or rites of hospitality he had spread before him,
no, he dined him, then he murdered him, commandeered
those hard-hoofed mares for the hero’s own grange.
Still on the trail of these when he met Odysseus,
Iphitus gave him the bow his father, mighty Eurytus,
used to wield as a young man, but when he died
in his lofty house he left it to his son.
In turn, Odysseus gave his friend a sharp sword
and a rugged spear to mark the start of friendship,
treasured ties that bind. But before they got to know
the warmth of each other’s board, the son of Zeus
had murdered Iphitus, Eurytus’ magnificent son
who gave the prince the bow.
That great weapon—
King Odysseus never took it abroad with him
when he sailed off to war in his long black ships.
He kept it stored away in his stately house,
guarding the memory of a cherished friend,
and only took that bow on hunts at home.
Now,
the lustrous queen soon reached the hidden vault
and stopped at the oaken doorsill, work an expert
sanded smooth and trued to the line some years ago,
planting the doorjambs snugly, hanging shining doors.
At once she loosed the thong from around its hook,
inserted the key and aiming straight and true,
shot back the bolts—and the rasping doors groaned
as loud as a bull will bellow, champing grass at pasture.
So as the key went home those handsome double doors
rang out now and sprang wide before her.
She stepped onto a plank where chests stood tall,
brimming with clothing scented sweet with cedar.
Reaching, tiptoe, lifting the bow down off its peg,
still secure in the burnished case that held it,
down she sank, laying the case across her knees,
and dissolved in tears with a high thin wail
as she drew her husband’s weapon from its sheath …
Then, having wept and sobbed to her heart’s content,
off she went to the hall to meet her proud admirers,
cradling her husband’s backsprung bow in her arms,
its quiver bristling arrows, shafts of pain.
Her women followed, bringing a chest that held
the bronze and the iron axes, trophies won by the master.
That radiant woman, once she reached her suitors,
drawing her glistening veil across her cheeks,
paused now where a column propped the sturdy roof,
with one of her loyal handmaids stationed either side,
and delivered an ultimatum to her suitors:
“Listen to me, my overbearing friends!
You who plague this palace night and day,
drinking, eating us out of house and home
with the lord and master absent, gone so long—
the only excuse that you can offer is your zest
to win me as your bride. So, to arms, my gallants!
Here is the prize at issue, right before you, look—
I set before you the great bow of King Odysseus now!
The hand that can string this bow with greatest ease,
that shoots an arrow clean through all twelve axes—
he is the man I follow, yes, forsaking this house
where I was once a bride, this gracious house
so filled with the best that life can offer—
I shall always remember it, that I know …
even in my dreams.”
She turned to Eumaeus,
ordered the good swineherd now to set the bow
and the gleaming iron axes out before the suitors.
He broke into tears as he received them, laid them down.
The cowherd wept too, when he saw his master’s bow.
But Antinous wheeled on both and let them have it:
“Yokels, fools—you can’t tell night from day!
You mawkish idiots, why are you sniveling here?
You’re stirring up your mistress! Isn’t she drowned
in grief already? She’s lost her darling husband.
Sit down. Eat in peace, or take your snuffling
out of doors! But leave that bow right here—
our crucial test that makes or breaks us all.
No easy game, I wager, to string his polished bow.
Not a soul in the crowd can match Odysseus—
what a man he was …
I saw him once, remember him to this day,
though I was young and foolish way back then.”
Smooth talk,
but deep in the suitor’s heart his hopes were bent
on stringing the bow and shooting through the axes.
Antinous—fated to be the first man to taste
an arrow whipped from great Odysseus’ hands,
the king he mocked, at ease in the king’s house,
egging comrades on to mock him too.
“Amazing!”
Prince Telemachus waded in with a laugh:
“Zeus up there has robbed me of my wits.
My own dear mother, sensible as she is,
says she’ll marry again, forsake our house,
and look at me—laughing for all I’m worth,
giggling like some fool. Step up, my friends!
Here is the prize at issue, right before you, look—
a woman who has no equal now in all Achaean country,
neither in holy Pylos, nor in Argos or Mycenae,
not even Ithaca itself or the loamy mainland.
You know it well. Why sing my mother’s praises?
Come, let the games begin! No dodges, no delays,
no turning back from the stringing of the bow—
we’ll see who wins, we will.
I’d even take a crack at the bow myself …
If I string it and shoot through all the axes,
I’d worry less if my noble mother left our house
with another man and left me here behind—man enough
at last to win my father’s splendid prizes!”
With that
he leapt to his feet and dropped his bright red cloak,
slipping the sword and sword-belt off his shoulders.
First he planted the axes, digging a long trench,
one for all, and trued them all to a line,
then tamped the earth to bed them. Wonder took
the revelers looking on: his work so firm, precise,
though he’d never seen the axes ranged before.
He stood at the threshold, poised to try the bow …
Three times he made it shudder, straining to bend it,
three times his power flagged—but his hopes ran high
he’d string his father’s bow and shoot through every iron
and now, struggling with all his might for the fourth time,
he would have strung the bow, but Odysseus shook his head
and stopped him short despite his tensing zeal.
“God help me,” the inspired prince cried out,
“must I be a weakling, a failure all my life?
Unless I’m just too young to trust my hands
to fight off any man who rises up against me.
Come, my betters, so much stronger than I am—
try the bow and finish off the contest.”
He propped his father’s weapon on the ground,
tilting it up against the polished well-hung doors
and resting a shaft aslant the bow’s fine horn,
then back he went to the seat that he had left.
“Up, friends!” Antinous called, taking over.
“One man after another, left to right,
starting from where the steward pours the wine.”
So Antinous urged and all agreed.
The first man up was Leodes, Oenops’ son,
a seer who could see their futures in the smoke,
who always sat by the glowing winebowl, well back,
the one man in the group who loathed their reckless ways,
appalled by all their outrage. His turn first …
Picking up the weapon now and the swift arrow,
he stood at the threshold, poised to try the bow
but failed to bend it. As soon as he tugged the string
his hands went slack, his soft, uncallused hands,
and he called back to the suitors, “Friends,
I can’t bend it. Take it, someone—try.
Here is a bow to rob our best of life and breath,
all our best contenders! Still, better be dead
than live on here, never winning the prize
that tempts us all—forever in pursuit,
burning with expectation every day.
If there’s still a suitor here who hopes,
who aches to marry Penelope, Odysseus’ wife,
just let him try the bow; he’ll see the truth!
He’ll soon lay siege to another Argive woman
trailing her long robes, and shower her with gifts—
and then our queen can marry the one who offers most,
the man marked out by fate to be her husband.”
With those words he thrust the bow aside,
tilting it up against the polished well-hung doors
and resting a shaft aslant the bow’s fine horn,
then back he went to the seat that he had left.
But Antinous turned on the seer, abuses flying:
“Leodes! what are you saying? what’s got past your lips?
What awful, grisly nonsense—it shocks me to hear it—
‘here is a bow to rob our best of life and breath!’
Just because you can’t string it, you’re, so weak?
Clearly your genteel mother never bred her boy
for the work of bending bows and shooting arrows.
We have champions in our ranks to string it quickly.
Hop to it, Melanthius!”—he barked at the goatherd—
“Rake the fire in the hall, pull up a big stool,
heap it with fleece and fetch that hefty ball
of lard from the stores inside. So we young lords
can heat and limber the bow and rub it down with grease
before we try again and finish off the contest!”
The goatherd bustled about to rake the fire
still going strong. He pulled up a big stool,
heaped it with fleece and fetched the hefty ball
of lard from the stores inside. And the young men
limbered the bow, rubbing it down with hot grease,
then struggled to bend it back but failed. No use—
they fell far short of the strength the bow required.
Antinous still held off, dashing Eurymachus too,
the ringleaders of all the suitors,
head and shoulders the strongest of the lot.
But now
the king’s two men, the cowherd and the swineherd,
had slipped out of the palace side-by-side
and great Odysseus left the house to join them.
Once they were past the courtyard and the gates
he probed them deftly, surely: “Cowherd, swineherd,
what, shall I blurt this out or keep it to myself?
No, speak out. The heart inside me says so.
How far would you go to fight beside Odysseus?
Say he dropped like that from a clear blue sky
and a god brought him back—
would you fight for the suitors or your king?
Tell me how you feel inside your hearts.”
“Father Zeus,” the trusty cowherd shouted,
“bring my prayer to pass! Let the master come—
some god guide him now! You’d see my power,
my fighting arms in action!”
Eumaeus echoed his prayer to all the gods
that their wise king would soon come home again.
Certain at least these two were loyal to the death,
Odysseus reassured them quickly: “I’m right here,
here in the flesh—myself—and home at last,
after bearing twenty years of brutal hardship.
Now I know that of all my men you two alone
longed for my return. From the rest I’ve heard
not one real prayer that I come back again.
So now I’ll tell you what’s in store for you.
If a god beats down the lofty suitors at my hands,
I’ll find you wives, both of you, grant you property,
sturdy houses beside my own, and in my eyes you’ll be
comrades to Prince Telemachus, brothers from then on.
Come, I’ll show you something—living proof—
know me for certain, put your minds at rest.
This scar,
look, where a boar’s white tusk gored me, years ago,
hunting on Parnassus, Autolycus’ sons and I.”
With that,
pushing back his rags, he revealed the great scar …
And the men gazed at it, scanned it, knew it well,
broke into tears and threw their arms around their master—
lost in affection, kissing his head and shoulders,
and so Odysseus kissed their heads and hands.
Now the sun would have set upon their tears
if Odysseus had not called a halt himself.
“No more weeping. Coming out of the house
a man might see us, tell the men inside.
Let’s slip back in—singly, not in a pack.
I’ll go first. You’re next. Here’s our signal.
When all the rest in there, our lordly friends,
are dead against my having the bow and quiver,
good Eumaeus, carry the weapon down the hall
and put it in my hands. Then tell the serving-women
to lock the snugly fitted doors to their own rooms.
If anyone hears from there the jolting blows
and groans of men, caught in our huge net,
not one of them show her face—
sit tight, keep to her weaving, not a sound.
You, my good Philoetius, here are your orders.
Shoot the bolt of the courtyard’s outer gate,
lock it, lash it fast.”
With that command
the master entered his well-constructed house
and back he went to the stool that he had left.
The king’s two men, in turn, slipped in as well.
Just now Eurymachus held the bow in his hands,
turning it over, tip to tip, before the blazing fire
to heat the weapon. But he failed to bend it even so
and the suitor’s high heart groaned to bursting.
“A black day,” he exclaimed in wounded pride,
“a blow to myself, a blow to each man here!
It’s less the marriage that mortifies me now—
that’s galling too, but lots of women are left,
some in seagirt Ithaca, some in other cities.
What breaks my heart is the fact we fall so short
of great Odysseus’ strength we cannot string his bow.
A disgrace to ring in the ears of men to come.”
“Eurymachus,” Eupithes’ son Antinous countered,
“it will never come to that, as you well know.
Today is a feast-day up and down the island
in honor of the Archer God. Who flexes bows today?
Set it aside. Rest easy now. And all the axes,
let’s just leave them planted where they are.
Trust me, no one’s about to crash the gates
of Laertes’ son and carry off these trophies.
Steward, pour some drops for the god in every cup,
we’ll tip the wine, then put the bow to bed.
And first thing in the morning have Melanthius
bring the pick of his goats from all his herds
so we can burn the thighs to Apollo, god of archers—
then try the bow and finish off the contest.”
Welcome advice. And again they all agreed.
Heralds sprinkled water over their hands for rinsing,
the young men brimmed the mixing bowls with wine,
they tipped first drops for the god in every cup,
then poured full rounds for all. And now, once
they’d tipped libations out and drunk their fill,
the king of craft, Odysseus, said with all his cunning,
“Listen to me, you lords who court the noble queen.
I have to say what the heart inside me urges.
I appeal especially to Eurymachus, and you,
brilliant Antinous, who spoke so shrewdly now.
Give the bow a rest for today, leave it to the gods—
at dawn the Archer God will grant a victory
to the man he favors most.
For the moment,
give me the polished bow now, won’t you? So,
to amuse you all, I can try my hand, my strength …
is the old force still alive inside these gnarled limbs?
Or has a life of roaming, years of rough neglect,
destroyed it long ago?”
Modest words
that sent them all into hot, indignant rage,
fearing he just might string the polished bow.
So Antinous rounded on him, dressed him down:
“Not a shred of sense in your head, you filthy drifter!
Not content to feast at your ease with us, the island’s pride?
Never denied your full share of the banquet, never,
you can listen in on our secrets. No one else
can eavesdrop on our talk, no tramp, no beggar.
The wine has overpowered you, heady wine—
the ruin of many another man, whoever
gulps it down and drinks beyond his limit.
Wine—it drove the Centaur, famous Eurytion,
mad in the halls of lionhearted Pirithous.
There to visit the Lapiths, crazed with wine
the headlong Centaur bent to his ugly work
in the prince’s own house! His hosts sprang up,
seized with fury, dragged him across the forecourt,
flung him out of doors, hacking his nose and ears off
with their knives, no mercy. The creature reeled away,
still blind with drink, his heart like a wild storm,
loaded with all the frenzy in his mind!
And so
the feud between mortal men and Centaurs had its start.
But the drunk was first to bring disaster on himself
by drowning in his cups. You too, I promise you
no end of trouble if you should string that bow.
You’ll meet no kindness in our part of the world—
we’ll sail you off in a black ship to Echetus,
the mainland king who wrecks all men alive.
Nothing can save you from his royal grip!
So drink, but hold your peace,
don’t take on the younger, stronger men.”
“Antinous,” watchful Penelope stepped in,
“how impolite it would be, how wrong, to scant
whatever guest Telemachus welcomes to his house.
You really think—if the stranger trusts so to his hands
and strength that he strings Odysseus’ great bow—
he’ll take me home and claim me as his bride?
He never dreamed of such a thing, I’m sure.
Don’t let that ruin the feast for any reveler here.
Unthinkable—nothing, nothing could be worse.”
Polybus’ son Eurymachus had an answer:
“Wise Penelope, daughter of Icarius, do we really
expect the man to wed you? Unthinkable, I know.
But we do recoil at the talk of men and women.
One of the island’s meaner sort will mutter,
‘Look at the riffraff courting a king’s wife.
Weaklings, look, they can’t even string his bow.
But along came this beggar, drifting out of the blue—
strung his bow with ease and shot through all the axes!’
Gossip will fly. We’ll hang our heads in shame.”
“Shame?” alert Penelope protested—
“How can you hope for any public fame at all?
You who disgrace, devour a great man’s house and home!
Why hang your heads in shame over next to nothing?
Our friend here is a strapping, well-built man
and claims to be the son of a noble father.
Come, hand him the bow now, let’s just see …
I tell you this—and I’ll make good my word—
if he strings the bow and Apollo grants him glory,
I’ll dress him in shirt and cloak, in handsome clothes,
I’ll give him a good sharp lance to fight off men and dogs,
give him a two-edged sword and sandals for his feet
and send him off, wherever his heart desires.”
“Mother,”
poised Telemachus broke in now, “my father’s bow—
no Achaean on earth has more right than I
to give it or withhold it, as I please.
Of all the lords in Ithaca’s rocky heights
or the islands facing Elis grazed by horses,
not a single one will force or thwart my will,
even if I decide to give our guest this bow—
a gift outright—to carry off himself.
So, mother,
go back to your quarters. Tend to your own tasks,
the distaff and the loom, and keep the women
working hard as well. As for the bow now,
men will see to that, but I most of all:
I hold the reins of power in this house.”
Astonished,
she withdrew to her own room. She took to heart
the clear good sense in what her son had said.
Climbing up to the lofty chamber with her women,
she fell to weeping for Odysseus, her beloved husband,
till watchful Athena sealed her eyes with welcome sleep.
And now the loyal swineherd had lifted up the bow,
was taking it toward the king, when all the suitors
burst out in an ugly uproar through the palace—
brash young bullies, this or that one heckling,
“Where on earth are you going with that bow?”
“You, you grubby swineherd, are you crazy?”
“The speedy dogs you reared will eat your corpse—”
“Out there with your pigs, out in the cold, alone!”
“If only Apollo and all the gods shine down on us!”
Eumaeus froze in his tracks, put down the bow,
panicked by every outcry in the hall.
Telemachus shouted too, from the other side,
and full of threats: “Carry on with the bow, old boy!
If you serve too many masters, you’ll soon suffer.
Look sharp, or I’ll pelt you back to your farm
with flying rocks. I may be younger than you
but I’m much stronger. If only I had that edge
in fists and brawn over all this courting crowd,
I’d soon dispatch them—licking their wounds at last—
clear of our palace where they plot their vicious plots!”
His outburst sent them all into gales of laughter,
blithe and oblivious, that dissolved their pique
against the prince. The swineherd took the bow,
carried it down the hall to his ready, waiting king
and standing by him, placed it in his hands,
then he called the nurse aside and whispered,
“Good Eurycleia—Telemachus commands you now
to lock the snugly fitted doors to your own rooms.
If anyone hears from there the jolting blows
and groans of men, caught in our huge net,
not one of you show your face—
sit tight, keep to your weaving, not a sound.”
That silenced the old nurse—
she barred the doors that led from the long hall.
The cowherd quietly bounded out of the house
to lock the gates of the high-stockaded court.
Under the portico lay a cable, ship’s tough gear:
he lashed the gates with this, then slipped back in
and ran and sat on the stool that he’d just left,
eyes riveted on Odysseus.
Now he held the bow
in his own hands, turning it over, tip to tip,
testing it, this way, that way … fearing worms
had bored through the weapon’s horn with the master gone abroad.
A suitor would glance at his neighbor, jeering, taunting,
“Look at our connoisseur of bows!”
“Sly old foxmaybe
he’s got bows like it, stored in his house.”
“That or he’s bent on making one himself.”
“Look how he twists and turns it in his hands!”
“The clever tramp means trouble—”
“I wish him luck,” some cocksure lord chimed in,
“as good as his luck in bending back that weapon!”
So they mocked, but Odysseus, mastermind in action,
once he’d handled the great bow and scanned every inch,
then, like an expert singer skilled at lyre and song—
who strains a string to a new peg with ease,
making the pliant sheep-gut fast at either end—
so with his virtuoso ease Odysseus strung his mighty bow.
Quickly his right hand plucked the string to test its pitch
and under his touch it sang out clear and sharp as a swallow’s cry.
Horror swept through the suitors, faces blanching white,
and Zeus cracked the sky with a bolt, his blazing sign,
and the great man who had borne so much rejoiced at last
that the son of cunning Cronus flung that omen down for him.
He snatched a winged arrow lying bare on the board—
the rest still bristled deep inside the quiver,
soon to be tasted by all the feasters there.
Setting shaft on the handgrip, drawing the notch
and bowstring back, back … right from his stool,
just as he sat but aiming straight and true, he let fly—
and never missing an ax from the first ax-handle
clean on through to the last and out
the shaft with its weighted brazen head shot free!
“My son,”
Odysseus looked to Telemachus and said, “your guest,
sitting here in your house, has not disgraced you.
No missing the mark, look, and no long labor spent
to string the bow. My strength’s not broken yet,
not quite so frail as the mocking suitors thought.
But the hour has come to serve our masters right—
supper in broad daylight—then to other revels,
song and dancing, all that crowns a feast.”
He paused with a warning nod, and at that sign
Prince Telemachus, son of King Odysseus,
girding his sharp sword on, clamping hand to spear,
took his stand by a chair that flanked his father—
his bronze spearpoint glinting now like fire …
