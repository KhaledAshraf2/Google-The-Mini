Foundation Concepts:
Information Systems in Business
The question of why we need to study information systems and information technology
has evolved into a moot issue. Information systems have become as integrated into our
daily business activities as accounting, finance, operations management, marketing, human
resource management, or any other major business function. Information systems
and technologies are vital components of successful businesses and organizations—some
would say they are business imperatives. They thus constitute an essential field of study
in business administration and management, which is why most business majors include
a course in information systems. Since you probably intend to be a manager, entrepreneur,
or business professional, it is just as important to have a basic understanding of
information systems as it is to understand any other functional area in business.
Information technologies, including Internet-based information systems, are playing
vital and expanding roles in business. Information technology can help all kinds of
businesses improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their business processes, managerial
decision making, and workgroup collaboration, which strengthens their competitive
positions in rapidly changing marketplaces. This benefit occurs irrespective of
whether the information technology is used to support product development teams,
customer support processes, e-commerce transactions, or any other business activity.
Information technologies and systems are, quite simply, an essential ingredient for
business success in today’s dynamic global environment.
Let’s take a moment to bring the real world into our discussion of the importance of
information systems (IS) and information technology (IT). See Figure 1.1 , and read
the Real World Case about using information technology to better understand and
satisfy customer needs.
If we are to understand information systems and their functions, we first need to
be clear on the concept of a system. In its simplest form, a system is a set of interrelated
components, with a clearly defined boundary, working together to achieve a
common set of objectives. Using this definition, it becomes easy to see that virtually
everything you can think of is a system, and one system can be made up of other systems
or be part of a bigger system. We will expand on this concept later in the next
section, but for now, this definition gives us a good foundation for understanding the
focus of this textbook: information systems.
We begin with a simple definition that we can expand upon later in the chapter. An
information system (IS) can be any organized combination of people, hardware, software,
communications networks, data resources, and policies and procedures that
stores, retrieves, transforms, and disseminates information in an organization. People
rely on modern information systems to communicate with one another using a variety
of physical devices (hardware) , information processing instructions and procedures
(software) , communications channels (networks) , and stored data (data resources) . Although
today’s information systems are typically thought of as having something to do
with computers, we have been using information systems since the dawn of civilization.
Even today we make regular use of information systems that have nothing to do
with a computer. Consider some of the following examples of information systems:
• Smoke signals for communication were used as early as recorded history and
can account for the human discovery of fire. The pattern of smoke transmitted
valuable information to others who were too far to see or hear the sender.
• Card catalogs in a library are designed to store data about the books in an organized
manner that allows readers to locate a particular book by its title, author
name, subject, or a variety of other approaches.

What Is an
Information System?
SECTION I
eCourier, Cablecom, and Bryan Cave:
Delivering Value through Business
Intelligence
a market where many courier companies use telephone dispatchers
and guesswork about package whereabouts. Booking
and tracking automation—while innovative—did not
complete the customer happiness puzzle. Without leadingedge
business intelligence, account managers could miss
the same issues that plagued other courier services—late
deliveries, surly couriers, or even an unnoticed ramp-up in
deliveries. “We’re only one delivery away from someone
deciding to use a different delivery firm,” says Bregman.
So eCourier started using software from a company called
SeeWhy to try and generate customer data more quickly.
“What’s unique about SeeWhy,” says Bregman, “is its ability to
report what’s happening with customers instantly.” When a
new booking enters eCourier’s database, the information is duplicated
and saved into a repository within SeeWhy. The software
then interprets the data by comparing it with previous
information and trends, and if it notices an anomaly, it takes
action. If a customer typically places an eCourier order every
Thursday morning between 9:30 and 10:00 and there’s been
no contact during that time, eCourier’s CRM team will receive
an alert shortly after 10:00 that includes the client’s history and
the number of bookings it typically places in a day. Bregman
says there’s a fair amount of tuning to get the metrics right. For
example, the company had to tweak the system to recognize
expected shifts in activity so that it doesn’t send a slew of alerts
once the after-Christmas drop in business occurs. Getting that
perfect balance of when to send alerts and how best to optimize
the system is an ongoing process, he says.
The SeeWhy software is designed to establish a “normal”
client booking pattern from the first use, which is deepened
with each subsequent booking. A sharp drop-off in bookings,
an increase in bookings, or a change in dormant account activity
generates an alert that is sent to that client’s account
manager, who then uses the opportunity to problem-solve or,
in the case of increased activity, upsell, for example, to overnight
or international services. “These capabilities have provided
a big payoff,” says Bregman. He also believes the system
saves his company the expense of having to hire people to
monitor for “who’s happy and who’s not—we’re able to do a
lot more on our customer team with a lot less.”
There are other approaches to judging customer dissatisfaction,
however. Cablecom, a Swiss telecom company, used
SPSS’s statistical software to mine customer data, primarily
from trouble tickets—such as the average duration of a ticket,
or how many tickets had been opened for a customer over a
specific time period—to build a model that could flag when a
customer was at a high risk of leaving. “But the model proved
to be only about 70% accurate,” says Federico Cesconi, director
of customer insight and retention.
So Cesconi used SPSS’s Dimensions survey research
software to create an online customer survey, and from that
he was able to determine that customer dissatisfaction usually
begins around the ninth month of service, with the bulk
of the customer losses occurring between months 12 and 14.
Cesconi then created another survey that he now offers to
V isitors to the eCourier Web site are greeted with
the words “How happy are you ? Take the eCourier
happy test today!” Those words and the playful
purple Web site represent the company’s customer satisfaction
focus. And a key for the company in achieving that happiness
is through its focus on operational business intelligence.
Business intelligence is moving out of the ivory tower of
specialized analysts and is being brought to the front lines.
In the case of eCourier, whose couriers carry 2,000 packages
around London each day, operational business intelligence
allows the company to keep real-time tabs on customer satisfaction.
“This is a crucial differentiator in London’s competitive
same-day courier market, where clients are far more
likely to take their business elsewhere than they are to report
a problem to their current courier,” says the company’s chief
technology officer and cofounder Jay Bregman.
Online directory London Online alone shows about 350
listings for courier services.
Before implementing operational business intelligence,
eCourier sought to define IT as a crucial differentiator. Cofounders
Tom Allason, eCourier’s CEO, and Bregman ditched
the idea of phone dispatchers and instead gave their couriers
GPS-enabled handhelds so that couriers can be tracked and
orders can be communicated electronically. They also focused
on making online booking easy and rewarding; and much was
invested in user-friendly applications: Customers can track
online exactly where their courier is, eliminating the package
delivery guesswork.
Today, 95 percent of deliveries are booked online,
meaning that eCourier needs a much smaller staff for monitoring,
tracking, and placing orders, which in turn makes
the company more scalable. Bregman says this is notable in
customers in the seventh month of service, and which includes
an area where they can type in specific complaints and
problems. “Cablecom calls customers within 24 hours of
completing the survey,” says Cesconi. “The two approaches
together provide the best view of customers ready to bolt,
and the best chance at retaining them.”
In 2002, global law firm Bryan Cave faced the milliondollar
question: How do you make the most money with
your resources while simultaneously delivering the highest
customer value? The problem was pressing. Clients of the
firm, which now has 800 lawyers in 15 offices worldwide,
were demanding alternatives to the traditional hourly fee
structure. They wanted new models such as fixed pricing
and pricing that was adjusted during a project.
But making money off these new billing strategies required
the complicated balance of staffing and pricing.
Projects weighted too heavily with a law partner’s time
would be expensive (for the law firm) and not optimized for
profit. Devoting too little of a partner’s time would leave clients
feeling undervalued. Optimizing profit and perceived
value had to be achieved by spreading partners’ time throughout
a number of cases and balancing the remaining resources
needed for a case with the less-expensive fees of associates and
paralegals. “Clients are most likely to stay with you if you deliver
just the right mix,” says Bryan Cave’s CIO John Alber.
The law firm’s traditional method of analyzing collected
fees and profit used a spreadsheet that was complicated and
took too long. “Spreadsheets provide a level of detail that can
be valuable for analysts,” says Alber, “but the information in a
spreadsheet can be confusing and difficult to work with.” Alber
says he decided it was better to build an easy-to-understand
interface using business intelligence tools; although the company
will not release specific figures, Alber says since the company
implemented its first BI tool in 2004, both profitability
and hours leveraged—the hours worked by equity partners and
all other fee earners at the firm—have increased substantially.
The tools also allow lawyers to track budgets in real time
so that they can quickly make adjustments. The BI tools
even provide a diversity dashboard, which tracks the hourly
mix of women and minorities working on the firm’s cases, a
feature the company will license to Redwood Analytics for
sale to other law firms. The firm developed this diversity
tool to bring transparency to the diversity reporting process
required by many clients. In other words, the tools provide
Bryan Cave with a method of customizing its fees and helping
clients better understand what they get for their money.
As an illustration, Alber points to the customized pricing
one lawyer gave to his real estate client. “Developers
think in terms of square feet,” says Alber, “and this client
couldn’t understand why legal fees for a 400,000-squarefoot
building might be the same as for a 4,000-square-foot
building, though it required the same amount of the lawyer’s
time.” So the lawyer used the pricing and staffing
modeling tools and historical analysis tools to determine
whether it made sense for the law firm to charge clients
based on the size of their projects.
He found that while there was risk of underpricing large
buildings, the deal volume in small buildings offset that risk for
the law firm. The result made per-square-foot pricing possible.
“It may be possible that someone with enough willpower
or manpower could do that using traditional analysis,” says
Alber, “but this lawyer had the information right at his fingertips.”
Business intelligence enables “us to be in touch
with clients and shift things around in response to what customers
are asking,” says Alber. Adopting new and improved
project management, pricing, and customer service capabilities
required planning, appropriate pacing, and user buy-in.
“In today’s environment, you can’t do value innovation
without being in touch with the economics of your business,
without really understanding where you make money and
where you don’t, and that’s what business intelligence tools
do,” says Alber. “Our goal,” he says, “is to build the best
long-term relationships in the world.”

1. How do information technologies contribute to the business
success of the companies depicted in the case? Provide
an example from each company explaining how the
technology implemented led to improved performance.
2. In the case of law firm Bryan Cave discussed above, the
use of BI technology to improve the availability, access,
and presentation of existing information allowed them to
provide tailored and innovative services to their customers.
What other professions could benefit from a similar
use of these technologies, and how? Develop two different
possibilities.
3. Cablecom developed a prediction model to better identify
those customers at risk of switching to other company in
the near future. In addition to those noted in the case,
what other actions could be taken if that information
were available? Give some examples of these. Would you
consider letting some customers leave anyway? Why?
1. Use the Internet to research the latest offerings in
business intelligence technologies and their uses by
companies. What differences can you find with those
reviewed in the case? Prepare a report to summarize
your findings and highlight new and innovative uses of
these technologies.
2. Why do some companies in a given industry, like
eCourier above, adopt and deploy innovative technologies
while others in the same line of business do not?
Break into small groups with your classmates to discuss
what characteristics of companies could influence
their decision to innovate with the use of information
technologies.

6 ? Module I / Foundation Concepts
• Your book bag, day planner, notebooks, and file folders are all part of an information
system designed to help you organize the inputs provided to you via
handouts, lectures, presentations, and discussions. They also help you process
these inputs into useful outputs: homework and good exam grades.
• The cash register at your favorite fast-food restaurant is part of a large information
system that tracks the products sold, the time of a sale, inventory levels,
and the amount of money in the cash drawer; it also contributes to the analysis of
product sales in any combination of locations anywhere in the world.
• A paper-based accounting ledger as used before the advent of computer-based
accounting systems is an iconic example of an information system. Businesses
used this type of system for centuries to record the daily transactions and to keep
a record of the balances in their various business and customer accounts.
Figure 1.2 illustrates a useful conceptual framework that organizes the knowledge
presented in this text and outlines areas of knowledge you need about information
systems. It emphasizes that you should concentrate your efforts in the following five
areas of IS knowledge:
• Foundation Concepts. Fundamental behavioral, technical, business, and managerial
concepts about the components and roles of information systems. Examples
include basic information system concepts derived from general systems
theory or competitive strategy concepts used to develop business applications of
information technology for competitive advantage. Chapters 1 and 2 and other
chapters of the text support this area of IS knowledge.
• Information Technologies. Major concepts, developments, and management issues
in information technology—that is, hardware, software, networks, data management,
and many Internet-based technologies. Chapters 3 and 4 provide an overview of
computer hardware and software technologies, and Chapters 5 and 6 cover key data
resource management and telecommunications network technologies for business.
• Business Applications. The major uses of information systems for the operations,
management, and competitive advantage of a business. Chapter 7 covers
applications of information technology in functional areas of business such as
marketing, manufacturing, and accounting. Chapter 8 focuses on e-commerce
applications that most companies use to buy and sell products on the Internet,
and Chapter 9 covers the use of information systems and technologies to support
decision making in business.
• Development Processes. How business professionals and information specialists
plan, develop, and implement information systems to meet business opportunities.
Several developmental methodologies are explored in Chapter 10, including the
